\f0\fs24 \cf0 In this file there are three subfiles.\
-Bilkent Rush\
-ProjectMap\
-My Application\
\
*Bilkent Rush is the main game which we coded with swing methods. It is totally working on computer; however, it should open by eclipse. It is not an android app. It is finished. It was the first version.\
\
*My Application file is the android version of the Bilkent Rush file. It\'92s UI finished and it is coding mostly done; however, it is not finished. It can work on any android device; however, it can perform several things, which Bilkent Rush is doing, not all of it. Therefore it is not finished.This was the second versions main part.\
\
*ProjectMap is the part which we decided to use as a hint for the game. It is finished and working perfectly; however, we could not add it to My Application because we could not finish My Application. This part is working on Android Studio and any Android devices. This was the second versions map part.\
